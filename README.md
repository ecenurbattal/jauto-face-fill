# Jauto Face Fill
### A widget that you can use in your forms on Jotform that automatically fills in personal information with facial recognition.

When you add the widget to your form, it tries to identify the person filling out the form via webcam. If it is someone who is not known yet, it asks for the information to be filled this time and saves this information in a database form to be opened in your account. When this person wants to submit this form again, the widget will recognize him/her and fill in his/her data automatically.

#### Note: You need to enter your jotform apiKey in the widget settings.

#### You can try the widget on the form by clicking the link [here](https://form.jotform.com/212296882596067).
